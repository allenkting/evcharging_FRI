    "In recent years, significant advances have been made in smart grid technology and renewable energies in order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which emit harmful greenhouse gases. Along with these advances in power generation and distribution, electric vehicles (EVs) have also been increasingly adopted in cities throughout the U.S. However, effective strategies are necessary to build charging infrastructure to meet this new demand for EVs, and there are still many challenges that hinder the further expansion of EV usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "One issue is the convenience and accessibility of charging stations - the distribution of charging stations is not always effective, and with variations in charging demand and battery sizes, there is a need for charging stations to account for a rising number of EV users while maintaining efficiency. More substantial changes to usage patterns due to population changes or even the COVID-19 pandemic can also add to the difficulty of predicting where charging stations would be most effective. Thus, charging station infrastructure can still be improved."

    "\n",
    "Our approach to improve the accessibility of these charging stations is to utilize reinforcement learning to predict the expected demand at multiple locations, and to then choose optimal locations to deploy new charging stations to satisfy that demand. The goal is to maximize the coverage of new charging stations (meaning that the station is accessible to EVs within a certain distance) and minimize total costs using a predetermined budget as to ensure an efficient use of resources. Our model should also be able to adapt to new data that may show increases or decreases in overall EV usage and demand. By analyzing a variety of factors, the model will learn a useful strategy for placing charging stations."

    "We plan to set up an environment as described above and test multiple RL algorithms, taking into account the following factors:\n",
    "- Historical usage data from existing charging stations\n",
    "- Nearby points that could influence demand (e.g. schools, shops, hospitals, etc.)\n",
    "- Traffic data from nearby intersections\n",
    "- Average range of electric vehicles\n",
    "- Costs of deploying a new charging station (e.g. licensing, number and type of charging slots)\n",
    "- Charging station wait times and pricing\n",
    "- EV network\n",
    "- Other factors that could influence demand (hourly changes, peak demand, seasonal changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "These would serve as inputs for an RL agent to interact with and learn the best locations to place charging stations to meet charging demand. One example of a potentially useful dataset is shown below, which contains information about EV charging sessions in Boulder, Colorado, including for each session the total charging duration, energy costs, as well as the type and location of the charging station. We also plan to obtain traffic data from city and state transportation departments, charging station locations in U.S. cities from the US Department of Energy, and further information about the makes and models of EVs in addition to charging station costs."

    "We expect that our RL model will be able to find good locations for EV charging stations to best meet the charging demand in a given area of interest. Ideally, the model would be able to take in data from many different locations and be able to \"rank\" them based on how attractive they are as places to set up a charging station. Each location would eventually be judged in this way, and the model would then be able to pick out the best locations. This decision-making process could be visualized on a map, with certain areas having a higher priority to build a charging station. Overall, this will provide a way to use reinforcement learning to select candidate sites for EV charging station locations in the future, as the infrastructure continues to develop."
